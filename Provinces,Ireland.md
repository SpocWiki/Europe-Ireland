> There are four **Provinces of Ireland**: [[Connacht]], [[Leinster]], [[Munster]] and [[Ulster]]. 
> The Irish word for this territorial division, cÃºige, meaning "fifth part", 
> suggests that there were once five, 
> and at times [[Counties~Ireland/Meath|Meath]] has been considered to be the fifth province. 
> 
> In the medieval period, however, there were often more than five. 
> The number of provinces and their delimitation fluctuated until 1610, 
> when they were permanently set by the English administration of James I. 
> The provinces of Ireland no longer serve administrative or political purposes 
> but function as historical and cultural entities.
