> There are four **Provinces of Ireland**: [[Ireland,Provinces/Connacht]], [[Ireland,Provinces/Leinster]], [[Ireland,Provinces/Munster]] and [[Ireland,Provinces/Ulster]]. 
> The Irish word for this territorial division, cúige, meaning "fifth part", 
> suggests that there were once five, 
> and at times [[Ireland,Provinces/Leinster/Meath|Meath]] has been considered to be the fifth province. 
> 
> In the medieval period, however, there were often more than five. 
> The number of provinces and their delimitation fluctuated until 1610, 
> when they were permanently set by the English administration of James I. 
> The provinces of Ireland no longer serve administrative or political purposes 
> but function as historical and cultural entities.
