> The Irish state came into being in 1919 as the 32 county Irish Republic. 
> 
> In 1922, having seceded from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 
> under the Anglo-Irish Treaty, it became the Irish Free State. 
> 
> It comprised 26 counties, with 6 counties under the control of Unionists; 
> which became Northern Ireland in 1921. 
> 
> Bunreacht na hÉireann 1937 constitution renamed the 26 states 'Ireland'. 
> In 1949, only 26 counties explicitly became a republic 
> under the terms of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, 
> definitively ending its tenuous membership of the British Commonwealth. 
> 
> In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the European Communities (EC) 
> as a member state which would later become the European Union (EU).
>
> Upon its foundation, the Irish Free State was embroiled in a civil war 
> between nationalists supporting the Treaty and opponents who supported the existing Republic. 
> The pro-Treaty side, organised as Cumann na nGaedheal, emerged victorious from the conflict 
> and won subsequent elections. 
> They formed the government of the state until 1932, 
> when they peacefully handed over power to the anti-Treaty faction in Fianna Fáil, 
> who defeated them in an election. 
> 
> The Irish state, despite its violent beginnings, has remained a democracy throughout its existence. 
> Changes in the 1930s removed many of the links with Britain established under the Treaty 
> and Ireland's neutrality in the Second World War demonstrated its independence in foreign policy matters from Britain.
>
> In the economic sphere, the Irish state has had a mixed performance. 
> On independence, it was one of the wealthier countries in Europe per head of population. 
> However it also inherited from British rule the problems of unemployment, emigration, 
> uneven geographical development and lack of a native industrial base. 
> For much of its history, the state struggled to rectify these problems. 
> Particular peaks of emigration were recorded during the 1930s, 1950s and 1980s, 
> when the Irish economy recorded little growth.
>
> In the 1930s, Fianna Fáil governments attempted to create Irish domestic industries using subsidies and protective tariffs. In the late 1950s, these policies were dropped in favour of free trade with selected countries and encouraging of foreign investment with low taxes. This was expanded when Ireland entered the European Economic Community in 1973. In the 1990s and 2000s, Ireland experienced an economic boom known as the Celtic Tiger, in which the country's GDP surpassed many of its European neighbours. Immigration also surpassed emigration, bringing the state's population up to over 4 million. However, since 2008, Ireland has experienced a severe crisis in the banking sector and with sovereign debt. The resultant economic slump has deepened the effect of the world recession on Ireland till 2012. Since 2012 unemployment rates and the economy has grown except around Covid. In the global GDP per capita tables, Ireland ranks 4th of 186 in the IMF table and 4th of 187 in the World Bank ranking.

> From 1937 to 1998, the Irish constitution included an irredentist claim on Northern Ireland as a part of the national territory. However, the state also opposed and used its security forces against those armed groups – principally the Provisional Irish Republican Army – who tried to unite Ireland by force. This occurred in the 1950s, throughout the 1970s and 1980s and has continued on a reduced scale. Irish governments meanwhile tried to broker an agreement to the conflict known as the Troubles within Northern Ireland from 1968 to the late 1990s. The British government officially recognised the right of the Irish government to be a party to the Northern negotiations in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985. In 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish constitution was altered by referendum to remove the territorial claim to Northern Ireland and instead extend the right of Irish citizenship to all the people of the island should they wish to have it.
